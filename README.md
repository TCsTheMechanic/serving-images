## Development Installation

First of all create your .env file based on .env.example

Than **Create a folder called images at the root of the project** and put all the images inside it

It's good to know that the ideal image size is 1024x1024

And last but not least run the command below

```bash
# install project dependencies
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run dev
```

## Production deploy

```bash
# install project dependencies
$ npm install

# run project build
npm run build

# start the project
npm run start
```
